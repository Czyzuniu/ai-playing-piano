# p5js-boilerplate v0.2.0 
This repository serves as a template for writing [Processing](https://processing.org/) code for web browsers. It is based on the [p5js](http://p5js.org/) framework for Javascript. The template is ready to go, so you can instantly start writing code for your project and don't have to worry about the environment. By default, the HTML canvas displaying the code gets scaled full page and resizes with the browser window.

## How to
1. [Download](https://github.com/bsplt/p5js-boilerplate/download/p5js-boilerplate.zip) or clone the git.
2. Write your Processing code into `/js/main.js`.
You can follow the p5js [workflow](http://p5js.org/get-started/), use jQuery or write Javascript your style.
3. Change `index.html` to your requirements.
You can write HTML as you like and still have the Processing sketch in the background.
4. Launch your `index.html` and have fun.
